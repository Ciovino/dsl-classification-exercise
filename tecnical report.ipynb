    "## 1. Description\n",
    "Predicting patient survival rates in critically ill populations is a vital aspect of modern healthcare, with profound implications for clinical decision-making and patient management. Accurate predictions can inform timely and appropriate interventions, enhance the quality of life for patients, and aid in resource allocation within healthcare systems. By anticipating the likely outcomes of severe medical conditions, healthcare providers can prioritize care, implement palliative measures when necessary, and support patients and their families in making informed decisions about treatment options. This predictive capability is crucial for addressing the growing concerns surrounding end-of-life care, ensuring that patients receive compassionate and effective care that aligns with their wishes and medical needs.\n",

    "The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the binary outcome \"death\" for these patients, which signifies whether a patient survives or dies within a specified time frame."
